#Project Title: ATM
##Description: -React App- ATM front-end.  Deposits are always accepted in any denomination. Withdrawals are only allowed in $20 increments and IF the money is available in the balance.
##How to Run: go to https://karenkrejcie.github.io/atm/standalone.html
##Roadmap of Improvements: More work on front-end design. I couldn't get my CSS to apply even when using the react-esque className syntax.
